# Generative AI with LlamaIndex and Spring AI

This project demonstrates how to use LlamaIndex and Spring AI to create generative AI applications, such as chatbots, document summarizers, and content generators.

LlamaIndex is a Python library that enables you to leverage pre-trained language models and augment them with custom data sources, such as documents, databases, or APIs. Spring AI is a Java framework that provides a Spring-friendly API and abstractions for developing AI applications, such as ChatClient, VectorStore, and DocumentReader.

## Installation

To install this project, you need to have Python 3.8+, Java 11+, and Maven 3.6+ installed on your system. Then, follow these steps:

- Clone this repository: `git clone https://github.com/PraveenKS30/GenerativeAI.git`

## Usage

To run this project, you need to have an OpenAI API key.Set the following environment variables:

- `OPENAI_API_KEY`: Your OpenAI API key

You can also use a `.env` file to store these variables. 

To start the Spring Boot application, run: `mvn spring-boot:run`

To start the Streamlit web interface, run: `streamlit run app.py`

You can then access the web interface at [http://localhost:8501](^7^) and interact with the generative AI application.

## Demo

Here is a YouTube video that shows the generative AI application in action:
